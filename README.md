# AGI 1.0: Why We Have Already Reached AGI and a Cognitive Architecture Proposal to Evolve to the Next Levels

**White Paper v1.0.0**

## Executive Summary

AGI 1.0 is not a hypothetical future—it is our current reality. Thanks to transformer-based large language models and integrated cognitive systems, machines now exhibit:

* **Domain-general reasoning:** Seamlessly tackling tasks from legal analysis to creative writing with the same underlying system.
* **Contextual memory and continuity:** Sustaining coherent, long-form dialogues and multi-step workflows across sessions.
* **Multimodal communication:** Interpreting and generating text, images, and structured data in unified models.

While AGI 1.0 does not yet mirror human autonomy or consciousness, it represents a foundational shift: intelligence as a **shared, collaborative phenomenon** between humans and machines. Static benchmarks no longer capture its true nature; distributed, real‑world interactions drive emergent cognition.

This white paper argues that reaching AGI 2.0 and 3.0—and ultimately approaching ASI 1.0—requires focused investment in **architectural transformation**. Specifically, we propose three research fronts:

1. **Hierarchical Tokenization:** Structuring language generation across nested token layers (sentences, paragraphs, sections) to enable intentional planning and global coherence.
2. **Mind-First Frameworks:** Exploring non-neural computational substrates and consciousness metrics (e.g., IIT, Global Workspace) to build introspective, self-aware systems.
3. **Wisdom-Centric Simulations:** Designing rich, embodied environments where agents learn through social, ethical, and causal experiences, guided by the Equation of Wisdom (W = I^C).

Together, these fronts lay a clear roadmap for transforming emergent AGI 1.0 into structured thinkers, autonomous agents, and—eventually—wise systems capable of ethical, self-directed reasoning.
